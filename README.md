### nineString.
https://merejarvis.github.io/project-1/


A game where players must form as many words as they can in 90 seconds from a random string of 9 letters.

Players can choose to regenerate the random string **twice** during the game.

Hit **'Enter'** key to submit words.

Be fast enough and get into **COMBO!** mode where your points are multiplied!

Current top score > 12000! (can't remember exactly!)

### Conceptualization

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Any number of players** will be okay, switch turns will be great
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**, jQuery is not compulsory
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* **No canvas** project will be accepted, only HTML5 + CSS3 + JS please

---

### Dictionary

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Possible Improvements

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
